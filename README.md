## Project Title: Todo List Application by Vue.JS

## Description:

This is a simple application created in using Vue.JS. This is the second project I have created. The purpose of this project was to give me additional practice and experience in working with Vue.JS. The premise of this application is to allow users to create small notes that can help them remind of things and task they need to do. Users can create post-it like messages and leave themselves messages to remind themselves of things they need to do.
